# hitchhiker-rider

HitchHiker! Lets you go for shopping with other fellow students and share the ride fare. Looking from social perspective it gives you chance to know more students and interact with them during your ride. It is an android-based application. It asks for the minimal personal information. Since we have deep linked the application with Uber, we need official Uber App already installed in the phone. You have to select the timeslot to travel, from and to places and number of people travelling, boom there you go. Thatâ€™s it you are good to go with booking and have a ride! Also, you can update the ride details or delete the requested booking. We cannot be sure about the exact time when we can reach the decided pickup spot and hence we have given a timeslot of 0.5 hours within which students can group.

We have a Android Application Client and Java based Server which communicates and process the user request.
